# 🚫 IRCTC Automation Script Removed

Hello! 👋

Thank you for your interest in this project. I originally created and shared an automation script for logging into the IRCTC website using Puppeteer, Tesseract, and other tools. However, after reconsidering the ethical and legal implications, **I’ve decided to remove the script**.

⚠️ **Automating login or scraping activities on platforms like IRCTC may violate their Terms of Service** and could result in account bans or legal issues. This project was created purely for learning and experimentation with browser automation and CAPTCHA solving.

### 🙏 Thank You for Your Patience

I truly appreciate your interest and support. If you're exploring automation for ethical use cases (like testing your own sites or learning browser automation), feel free to reach out or fork this repository with your own safe ideas.

Stay curious — but stay responsible! 💻✨
